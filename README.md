# C++-program-2
this is my second program of c++ language in which i have done all arithmatic operations (+,-,/,*,%) :-
# include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int a= 20, b=10;
  int sum,diff,prod,div,mod;
	
  sum= a+b;
  diff= a-b;
  prod= a*b;
  div= a/b;
  mod= a%b;
	
  cout<<sum<<endl;
  cout<<diff<<endl;
  cout<<prod<<endl;
  cout<<div<<endl;
  cout<<mod<<endl;

  return 0
}
+ = addition.
- = difference.
* = product.
/ = division.
% = Module. ( which gives remainder.)

Here, we use integer data type for calculating arithmatic operations in which i calculate sum, product, division, difference and modulation.
this program will give output of the variables which i have input in int data type.
this data type cannot calculate decimal variables and integers do not need to be in double course "".
